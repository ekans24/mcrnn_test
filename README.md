# mcrnn-test
Testing out and implementation of Mask-RCNN on mainly cars.

# Github Repositories
Using the following for Mask_RCNN: https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN.git     
I will also use a pre-trained model for the weights which can be downloaded from https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/releases.

# Implementation
The code used to produced the images can be find in the script.py file and all the required packages are found in the requirements.txt file

# Sample image
